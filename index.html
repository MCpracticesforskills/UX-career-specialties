    <h5>It's no secret that colleges aren't what they used to be. Currently, colleges are outdated, irrelevent, and outrageously expensive. Instead, consider a career that pays well and doesn't require a college degree!</h5>

    <ul class="ux-careers-list-top-of-page">
        <li>UX Researcher</li>

        <li>UX/UI Developer</li>

        <h3>UX Researcher</h3>
        <h4>Median Average Pay:$87,609 according to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=UX_Researcher/Salary">PayScale</a> </h4>
        <h4>Work From Home: Yes</h4>
        <h4>Summary: A UX Researcher is responsible for user research, conducting user testing, and analyzing user patterns. A good UX Researcher can tell stakeholders what the users need and want.</h4>
        Here is a typical job description for a UX Researcher:
        <ul>
            <li>Have a hands-on approach with the process of research, prototyping, development, and testing</li>
            <li>Ability to communicate with users, stakeholders and developers</li>
            <li>Has knowledge of mobile design, psychology, interaction design, graphic design, and marketing disciplines</li>
            <li>Maintain and perform functional and visual updates on our products</li>
            <li>Create wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and storyboards</li>
            <li>Create user journey maps, user flows, use cases and user stories</li>
            
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with
        some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually
        conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or
        some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
